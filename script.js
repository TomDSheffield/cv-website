function yourJavaScriptCode() {
  // Your JavaScript code here
  alert("Hello, world!");
}
In this example, the JavaScript code is placed in an external file called script.js. The HTML file includes this file using the <script> tag with the src attribute, which specifies the path to the JavaScript file. The yourJavaScriptCode() function is then called when the "Click me" link is clicked.

Both inline and external JavaScript can be used to link HTML to JavaScript code. The choice depends on the complexity of your code and organization preferences.
